In his very last race for Renault – and quite possibly in Formula 1 – Nico Hulkenberg drove a stormer. It wasn’t quite enough to bag himself some points, but he did at least end up with your seal of approval...

**Nico Hulkenberg – 26.4%

 Valtteri Bottas – 15.1%

 Robert Kubica – 14%

 Max Verstappen – 9.5%

 Lewis Hamilton – 8.8%**

He started from pole, but twice he passed world champion Lewis Hamilton - on track - in order to secure the win. Plus he had to keep his cool on a restart just two laps from the chequered flag. No wonder Max Verstappen got your nod...

**Max Verstappen – 22.2%

 Alex Albon – 13.8%

 Charles Leclerc - 12.8%

 Carlos Sainz - 11.7%

He started sixth, but contact with Carlos Sainz in Turn 1 dropped Alex Albon to the back of the back. However, the Red Bull man never gave up, clawing his way back to fifth, despite three pit visits in what should have been a one- or two-stop race...

A disastrous start saw Verstappen going rapidly backwards after contact with Hamilton through the opening turns. Then came a puncture that dropped him to last place. But from there on in it was a classic comeback drive from the Dutchman…

 Lewis Hamilton - 17.6%

 Sebastian Vettel - 12.2%

 Daniel Ricciardo - 9.4%

He leapt past Sebastian Vettel with an incredible start and became the only driver ever to win a Grand Prix at Suzuka from the second row having controlled the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix. Your Driver of the Day is Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas...

He may have retired with technical problems mid-race, but Sebastian Vettel's blinding start - passing his pole-sitting Ferrari team mate and seizing the lead from P3 on the grid - helped him get your vote…

He started 11th on the grid and battled all his way up to fifth for McLaren - only for a car failure a lap from home to rob him of 10 points. Despite the heartbreak, at least Lando Norris's efforts were enough to get your vote…

 Lewis Hamilton - 24.8%

He had said on the Saturday that anything could happen in the race – and Max Verstappen was proved right on Sunday as he rode the Hockenheim storm to come through an epic, safety-car filled, wet-dry race for victory – no surprise, then, that you gave him the nod…

It looked like it was going to be a hard Austrian Grand Prix for Max Verstappen when he fell from second on the grid to seventh by the end of Lap 1. But his tremendous fightback through the field, capped off by a forceful overtake on Charles Leclerc for the lead with two laps to go, meant that Verstappen scooped the Driver of the Day plaudits at the Red Bull Ring, as he secured his second victory there in as many years.

Charles Leclerc looked to be favourite for pole position in Baku on Saturday – that was until he stacked his Ferrari into the barriers in Q2. He made amends on Sunday, though, coming from eighth on the grid to finish a fighting fifth – even bolting on a fresh set of tyres at the end to secure the fastest lap.

On Saturday in China, both Alexander Albon's confidence and his Toro Rosso STR14 took a big hit as the Thai driver suffered a huge crash in FP3. He got back on the horse though, and after missing qualifying as the team built him up a new car, Albon started from the pit lane, made a one-stop strategy work and secured 10th place on Toro Rosso's 250th Grand Prix appearance.
